# SignLanguageRecognition
A comparative study of image recognition in Sign Language using Deep Learning and machine learning approaches.


# Conclusion
While both approaches can be used for image classification tasks, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models. The machine learning algorithm performed poorly and was indicated by the accuracy score in the image classification task. The suitable for this task is to implement by Deep Learning (CNNs).

Deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can automatically learn meaningful features from raw pixel data. CNNs employ multiple layers of interconnected neurons that capture increasingly complex and abstract features, such as edges, textures, and shapes. These learned features are essential for accurate image classification.

Deep learning model can be trained in an end-to-end manner, meaning they learn to directly map raw image inputs to their corresponding class labels. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, which typically require manual feature engineering, deep learning bypasses the need for handcrafted feature extraction, thus eliminating the limitations imposed by humandesigned feature representations.

Deep learning models can handle large-scale and complex datasets effectively. With the availability of massive amounts of labeled image data, deep learning algorithms can be learned from a vast number of examples, capturing subtle patterns and variations. The ability to process and learn from massive datasets gives deep learning models a significant advantage in image classification tasks.

To summarize, deep learning models, particularly CNNs, demonstrate superior performance and interpretability in image classification tasks compared to traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and Decision Tree. Deep learning models require more computational resources and training time but offer the advantage of automatically learning complex features from raw data.
